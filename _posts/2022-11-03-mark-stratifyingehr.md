  abstract: |
    Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease affecting the joints. Beyond that, however, it's a very heterogeneous disease; patients vary in their comorbidities, treatment response, prognosis and aetiology. Our research group focusses on the resolution of this heterogeneity in order to facilitate more targeted research. Through the application of techniques from the "-omics" field and broader bioinformatics community (such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, NLP) to vast observational patient datasets we aim to answer questions such as; what phenotypes precede RA and does this convey any information regarding the subsequent disease? What does a typical trajectory towards the RA diagnosis look like and could we speed up those converging paths in a beneficial way? I will give an overview of the various project lines we have going on and the use of electronic health records (EHR's) therein
