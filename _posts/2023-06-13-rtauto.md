    How important is the architecture of a deep learning model used for auto-contouring in brachytherapy? What challenges do the data bring us? Is it possible to achieve clinically acceptable results, and if yes, how?.

  abstract: |
    Radiotherapy treatment planning for head and neck cancer (HNC) is a labor-intensive process which can take up to a day per patient. Additionally, plan quality is highly dependent on the experience of the treatment planner. We explore the performance of deep learning-based autoplanning in RayStation, which claims to generate clinically acceptable and deliverable treatment plans within 15 minutes.
